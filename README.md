# Party Push Mobile Repo

Party Push is a web and soon to be iOS app that crowdsources party and event management. Guests can report when food and drink items are low or out, alerting the host.

This is a repo for the mobile iOS app written in Swift. It calls lambdas which write to an AWS RDS instance. See "party-push-lambdas" repo for the lambda code.
