# Party Push Mobile Repo

Party Push is a web and soon to be iOS app (hosted at http://www.livepartyhelper.com) that crowdsources party and event management.

This is a repo for the mobile iOS app written in Swift. It calls lambdas which write to an AWS RDS instance. See "party-push-front-end" repo for the front end code.
